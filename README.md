# RATIONALE #

* First time installation procedures. A _quick-list_ of software to install with a focus on open-source projects mostly for the Microsoft Windows© realm. By the way, a repo in _perpetual_ progress
* This repo is a living document that will grow and adapt over time according to meet needs, budgets, CPU's power, internal projects, etc.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
    - A quick-list of software to install in a brand new CPU, with a focus on open-source software tools
* Version 1.01

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
    - Check [software to install.md](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/software-installations/src/master/pc_software_to_install.md)
* Configuration
    - There is no `this law applies to all` situation, since there is _some_ interdependencies between parties, ie: [Dstretch](http://www.dstretch.com/) needs [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html) and itself [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html) needs [Java](https://www.java.com/es/download/). The former example is a `rara avis` situation.
* Dependencies
    - Some software involved (mostly [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ) are prone to check inter-dependencies by default 
* Database configuration
    - Our database since minimal -at first- will evolve according operating system issues and needs. The same evolution of technology paradigms will result in deeply changes across time. 
* How to run tests
    - There is no `run-to-test` method to apply, at least, up to now
* Deployment instructions
    - Every softwre involves `install-uninstall` properties/method.
